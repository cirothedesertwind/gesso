CSS UI framework using HTML Attributes built using SASS.

## Rationale

After learning about HTML attribute selectors from Glen Maddern and Ben Schwarz's technique described in [AM CSS](http://amcss.github.io/), I thought it would be a great idea to formalize their ideas in a CSS framework.

I also intend on using the formal HTML tags where possible, e.g. not using a div as a button.

### Inspiration

This framework is inspired by the fine open source works that have come before it: Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation, Yahoo Pure, and Semantic UI.
